      <h1>Hi, I'm Joy Mbuvi</h1>
      <p>        
        I am a passionate backend developer with a strong foundation in Python, Django, and web development frameworks like Flask and React. I thrive in building scalable, efficient systems and have hands-on experience with technologies such as Django Rest Framework, JWT authentication, and integrating third-party APIs like Edamam. </p>

      Throughout my journey, Ive honed my skills by developing diverse projects, including a recipe web application where I implemented user authentication, favorites functionality, and integrated third-party APIs. My commitment to writing clean, maintainable code is matched by my enthusiasm for learning and solving problems. 
      My ambition lies in applying my technical skills to projects that contribute to a sustainable future. I am deeply committed to sustainability across all areasâ€”whether its designing eco-friendly software solutions or working for organizations whose values center around environmental impact. I aim to leverage technology to create systems and products that align with the principles of sustainability and innovation.
      I am excited about the opportunity to work on projects that make a positive impact, continuously grow as a developer, and contribute to building a more sustainable world.
      I have worked on various projects ranging from recipe websites to full-stack applications. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.</p>
